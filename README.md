# YOUi Widget Dashboard

![Home Page](images/screenshot.png)

## Description

The YOUi web application was created as a simple and easy-to-use dashboard interface that allows the user to add/remove/move/resize "widgets" which display useful/funny information and pictures - including:
- Weather
- News
- Updates on COVID-19
- Motivational/Thoughtful Quotes
- Ideas for Engaging Activities  
- Quotes from Kanye West 
- Random Dog Images
- Random Cat Facts
- Safe For Work Jokes

When the user loads the webpage, he/she can enter their name and location (zip code) and the web application will generate a default dashboard layout of widgets. 


## List of the APIs Used:

This web application employs 10 APIs:<br>
Weather     [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org) <br>
News        [newsapi.org](newsapi.org)<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>

## What Features You Would Add Next?

- Ability to hide API keys. Since frontend files have visible source code, it would be ideal to build a backend. Using the backend as a very simple API, the frontend would route the API requests without having to use the API keys in the urls.
- Package the web application for easy deployment in "smart-mirror" applications (i.e., raspberry pi, touch-screen lobby boards, elevator screens, etc.)

## Challenges


One of the harder parts of creating this app was rendering the grid stack widgets using the draggable, responsive bootstrap v4-friendly layouts.
